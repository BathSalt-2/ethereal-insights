# 🌌 Ethereal Insights v2.0

> *Walk the razor between rigorous science and the unknown.*

**The world's first quantum-benchmarked paranormal investigation platform.** Ethereal Insights doesn't just measure anomalies — it benchmarks them against certified Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) streams using Bell-like statistical tests, giving investigators a defensible, physics-grounded framework for evaluating unexplained phenomena.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

Most paranormal apps use basic EMF meters and audio recorders with no scientific framework. Ethereal Insights applies **real quantum physics** to anomaly detection:

- **Bell Inequality Testing** — Runs CHSH-style statistical tests on sensor data to flag non-classical correlations
- **QRNG Benchmarking** — Compares environmental entropy against certified quantum random streams (ANU, IDQ)
- **Quantum Entropy Analysis** — EVP screen isolates structured deviations from true randomness
- **S-Value Tracking** — Live Bell parameter monitoring with classical (S≤2) vs quantum (S>2) threshold display

The claim is defensible: *"We flag what the physics says is anomalous."*

## 📱 Seven Investigation Screens

| Screen | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **HOME** | Quantum HUD — live sensor readings, anomaly detection, S-value, QRNG deviation |
| **SCAN** | 200-particle quantum visualizer, Bell inequality meter, environmental sensor grid |
| **SPIRIT** | FM frequency sweep (87.5–108.0 MHz) with full Web Audio API engine — white noise + bandpass filter tracking frequency, sawtooth voice bursts on contact |
| **ECHO** | Llama 3.3 70B AI with full visibility into all session data — sensors, particles, spirit contacts, anomaly history |
| **EVP** | Entropy analysis comparing sensor data vs certified QRNG streams |
| **HUD** | Comprehensive quantum metrics dashboard |
| **LOG** | Complete session event history |

## 🎨 Visual Design

- **Theme**: Deep void black with animated purple/teal nebula gradients
- **Effects**: CRT scanline overlay, neon glow system (teal nominal · purple quantum · red anomalies · amber warnings)
- **Cards**: Glass morphism with light streaks
- **Typography**: Orbitron (brand) · Share Tech Mono (data) · Rajdhani (labels)
- **Mobile-first**: 70px bottom navigation, 48px minimum touch targets, keyboard-safe layouts

## 🤖 Echo AI — Quantum-Aware Analysis

Echo is powered by **Llama 3.3 70B running on Groq** with a live system prompt built from your actual session data every message:

- Current EMF, temperature, pressure, motion readings
- Bell S-value and anomaly count by severity
- Spirit Box sweep status and all logged contacts (word, frequency, entropy %, timestamp)
- Full conversation history (last 18 messages)

Echo reasons across all screens simultaneously — it can correlate a Spirit Box contact with a simultaneous EMF spike and explain what the quantum statistics actually say about it.

**API key management**: The Groq API key is stored securely in the agent's private server-side storage. It is never exposed to the client, never in localStorage, and never in this repository. The app works seamlessly with no configuration required.
